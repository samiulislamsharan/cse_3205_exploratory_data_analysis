# CSE-3205-Applied Statistics and Queuing Theory

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

An important skill for a data scientist is the ability to communicate findings from data analysis. For this task, you are going to import some data sets into R in order to conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA), and report on your findings.

Your individual datasets have been assigned to you in the following [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GGYD8L8t9foSWI8CMnmXsKc0fvp_L8XVhSrgncIIQH0/edit?usp=sharing). Further explanation of the datasets are [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html).

Using [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), explore the data set and prepare a report on your findings.

You should be able to:

- Describe the data in a quantitative and qualitative way; i.e., summary statistics on the shape of the data, along with a translation of these statistics for a business audience.
- Report on the number of observations, the number of variables, the qualitative (categorical) variables, and the quantitative (numeric) variables
- Further report on your analysis of any single variable, including measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation)
- Produce appropriate visualizations of your results.
- You may carry out this analysis for any number of single variables.

Your report should contain comments above each code and explanation of your outputs.

Note: Is this assignment mandatory? No, it's not. However, most of your quiz marks were substantially poor. So, this assignment is the only way to regain those marks. ðŸ˜…

Submission: Bring your reports printed on the day of finals.
